# ✈️ European Air Traffic Analysis (2016–2024)

This project is a Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) of European air traffic from 2016 to 2024. Using `pandas` and `matplotlib`, I combined and analyzed multiple CSV files representing annual flight data to uncover trends and insights across countries and time periods.

## 📊 Goals of the Analysis

- 📈 Explore **general air traffic trends** over the years (growth, decline, recovery)
- 🌍 Identify the **Top 10 European countries** by total air traffic
- ☀️ Analyze **top-performing countries during summer months**
- 🇷🇸 Compare **Serbia's air traffic** to the rest of Europe
